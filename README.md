# ResNeXt-Replication
repository contains  PyTorch implementation of ResNeXt, modular convolutional neural network that leverages aggregated residual transformations and grouped convolutions for image classification. The code replicates the ResNeXt architecture in a clear, extensible manner, allowing easy modification of cardinality, bottleneck width, and network depth.
